Hello ZwiftPower racers,

As part of Zwift HQ's efforts to safeguard our members' data privacy, discussions about ZwiftPower will transition from the ZwiftPower forums to forums.zwift.com
Why? The migration of ZwiftPower from its original server to Zwift HQ's server environment has important implications for both site stability and for data security.

The discussions, knowledge, and history from the ZwiftPower forum will be preserved and remain accessible here in read-only mode.
Please follow us to the new: ZwiftPower board, a small team of Zwift HQ staff will be on hand to answer questions and guide you through some of the changes.
